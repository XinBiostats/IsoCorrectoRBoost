# IsoCorrectoRBoost
This is a faster tool for Natural Isotopes Abundance (NIA) correction based on **IsoCorrectoR** (https://genomics.ur.de/files/IsoCorrectoR/.). We have optimized some details based on IsoCorrector, resulting in a significant improvement in correction speed, particularly for large datasets.

## Data Preparation
We need 3 files for NIA stripping: Measurement File, Element File and Molecule File.
### Measurement File
This file contains the measured data that needs to be corrected. See example: MeasurementFile
