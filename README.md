# IsoCorrectoRBoost
This is a faster tool for Natural Isotopes Abundance (NIA) correction based on **IsoCorrectoR** (https://genomics.ur.de/files/IsoCorrectoR/.) from Bioconductor. We have optimized some details based on IsoCorrector, resulting in a significant improvement in correction speed, particularly for large datasets.
